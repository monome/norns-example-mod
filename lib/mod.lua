--
-- require the `mods` module to gain access to hooks, menu, and other utility
-- functions.
--

local mod = require 'core/mods'

--
-- [optional] a mod is like any normal lua module. local variables can be used
-- to hold any state which needs to be accessible across hooks, the menu, and
-- any api provided by the mod itself.
--
-- here a single table is used to hold some x/y values
--

local state = {
  x = 0,
  y = 0,
}


--
-- [optional] hooks are essentially callbacks which can be used by multiple mods
-- at the same time. each function registered with a hook must also include a
-- name. registering a new function with the name of an existing function will
-- replace the existing function. using descriptive names (which include the
-- name of the mod itself) can help debugging because the name of a callback
-- function will be printed out by matron (making it visible in maiden) before
-- the callback function is called.
--
-- here we have dummy functionality to help confirm things are getting called
-- and test out access to mod level state via mod supplied fuctions.
--

mod.hook.register("system_post_startup", "my startup hacks", function()
  state.system_post_startup = true
end)

mod.hook.register("script_pre_init", "my init hacks", function()
  -- tweak global environment here ahead of the script `init()` function being called
end)


--
-- [optional] menu: extending the menu system is done by creating a table with
-- all the required menu functions defined.
--

local m = {}

m.key = function(n, z)
  if n == 2 and z == 1 then
    -- return to the mod selection menu
    mod.menu.exit()
  end
end

m.enc = function(n, d)
  if n == 2 then state.x = state.x + d
  elseif n == 3 then state.y = state.y + d end
  -- tell the menu system to redraw, which in turn calls the mod's menu redraw
  -- function
  mod.menu.redraw()
end

m.redraw = function()
  screen.clear()
  screen.move(64,40)
  screen.text_center(state.x .. "/" .. state.y)
  screen.update()
end

m.init = function() end -- on menu entry, ie, if you wanted to start timers
m.deinit = function() end -- on menu exit

-- register the mod menu
--
-- NOTE: `mod.this_name` is a convienence variable which will be set to the name
-- of the mod which is being loaded. in order for the menu to work it must be
-- registered with a name which matches the name of the mod in the dust folder.
--
mod.menu.register(mod.this_name, m)


--
-- [optional] returning a value from the module allows the mod to provide
-- library functionality to scripts via the normal lua `require` function.
--
-- NOTE: it is important for scripts to use `require` to load mod functionality
-- instead of the norns specific `include` function. using `require` ensures
-- that only one copy of the mod is loaded. if a script were to use `include`
-- new copies of the menu, hook functions, and state would be loaded replacing
-- the previous registered functions/menu each time a script was run.
--
-- here we provide a single function which allows a script to get the mod's
-- state table. using this in a script would look like:
--
-- local mod = require 'name_of_mod/lib/mod'
-- local the_state = mod.get_state()
--
local api = {}

api.get_state = function()
  return state
end

return api
